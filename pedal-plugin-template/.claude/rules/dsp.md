# DSP Rules (generic, circuit-modelled pedal)

## WDF Implementation

- Use **`chowdsp_wdf`** (header-only, C++17) for all circuit modelling.
- Use the **compile-time API** (`chowdsp::wdft` namespace), not the runtime `chowdsp::wdf` one —
  the compiler inlines all adaptors for near-zero call overhead. Only fall back to runtime API if a
  topology genuinely cannot be fixed at compile time (rare).
- **Use `double` for all WDF types.** `float` causes audible errors in diode Newton-Raphson at
  audio rates. Template every `ResistorT`, `CapacitorT`, `DiodePairT`, `DiodeT`, `RtypeAdaptor`,
  etc. on `double`.
- Op-amp stages: use the **ideal op-amp** model (`IdealVoltageSourceT` as the tree root driving an
  R-type adaptor, or `IdealOpAmpT` if present in your chowdsp_wdf version — check the header).
- **R-type adaptors for any feedback topology.** Derive the scattering matrix from nodal equations.
- **Never rebuild the WDF tree at runtime** for switch changes — precompute one scattering matrix
  per topology and swap via `setSMatrixData()` at the R-type adaptor.
- VREF = signal ground throughout: model **bipolar**, no power-supply node modelling (but DO model
  the op-amp output rails as a saturation — see calibration doc §6).

### Ideal op-amp decomposition (the workhorse pattern)

For an ideal op-amp the (−) input sits at the (+) input voltage and draws no current, so a
feedback stage decomposes into two independent one-ports:
```
Gain-set leg Zg (− input -> AC ground)   : Ig = Vin / Zg
Feedback leg  (− input -> output)        : Vf = (voltage Ig develops across the feedback leg)
Vout = Vin + Vf            (non-inverting)   // gain = 1 + Zf/Zg
```
This avoids a full R-type solve for simple stages. Nonlinear elements (clipping diodes) sit in the
feedback leg and only clamp `Vf` — the op-amp holds the (−) node regardless. Confirm output
polarity with a **DC-step test** in every stage; only add a `PolarityInverterT` if the readout sign
genuinely requires it (NOT reflexively for "inverting" op-amps — verify against the schematic).

### prepareToPlay requirements (missing these = silence or wrong behaviour)

- Call `.prepare(sampleRate)` on **every** `CapacitorT` / `CapacitorAlphaT` in every stage.
- Reset the oversampler.
- Each stage exposes `prepare(double sampleRate)` chaining down to its caps; the processor calls
  them in signal-chain order. JUCE calls `prepareToPlay` on every sample-rate change, so this also
  handles SR changes between sessions.

## Nonlinear elements (clipping diodes)

```cpp
// Antiparallel pair (symmetric clip):
wdft::DiodePairT<double, decltype(next), wdft::DiodeQuality::Good, AccurateOmega> dp { next, Is, Vt, nDiodes };
// Single diode (asymmetric clip):
wdft::DiodeT<double, decltype(next), wdft::DiodeQuality::Best, AccurateOmega> d { next, Is, Vt, nDiodes };
```
- Use **explicit per-component datasheet parameters**, never generic defaults. `nDiodes` is the
  **ideality factor n** (Shockley), NOT a physical count. (1N4148: Is=2.52e-9, Vt=25.85e-3, n=1.752.)
- chowdsp diodes have no series-Rs parameter; add an explicit `ResistorT` in series if Rs is
  audibly significant (usually negligible at guitar levels).

### Asymmetric clip modes — don't reach for the single `DiodeT`

`DiodePairT` is **symmetric** (same threshold both ways); `DiodeT` is **one-sided** (clips one
polarity, the other runs to the rail). A pedal's "asymmetric" switch position is usually NOT
one-sided — it's a **mild 2-sided asymmetry** (both polarities clip, at slightly different
thresholds, e.g. 1 diode one way vs 2 in series the other). The captures tell you: a one-sided
clip is strongly **even-dominant** (H2 is the biggest harmonic); a real "asym" mode is
**odd-dominant with moderate even** (H3 biggest, H2 ~6 dB below). Using `DiodeT` here gave H2 > H3
and was too loud/bright — wrong. Implement an **asymmetric antiparallel pair**: copy `DiodePairT`'s
"Good" path (Werner eqn 18) but use a different effective `Vt` per polarity (pick by `sign(a)`).
Tune the diode-count ratio to match the captured even/odd balance (1:2 matched in the reference
build). It still honours the OmegaProvider, so no omega4 floor.

### Omega accuracy gotcha (do NOT use the default omega)

chowdsp's default `Omega::omega` (omega4) uses bit-trick log/exp approximations that impose a
~−35 dB distortion floor — audible on a "transparent" pedal. Supply a custom **AccurateOmega**
provider (std::log/exp + a few Newton steps solving `w + ln(w) = x`).
**Trap:** `DiodePairT`'s `DiodeQuality::Best` path HARDCODES omega4 and ignores the provider — use
**`DiodeQuality::Good`** for the pair (eqn-18; accurate once given a true omega). `DiodeT` and the
pair's `Good` path both honour the provider. Verify with an audible-band aliasing test.

## Oversampling

- Apply oversampling to the **nonlinear stage only** — never the linear stages.
- `juce::dsp::Oversampling`; minimum 4×, prefer 8× for clipping. Expose 1×/2×/4×/8× in the UI.
- Re-discretise the nonlinear stage's caps at the oversampled rate so its response is preserved.
- Glitch-free factor switching: detect a pending change via `std::atomic<int>`, and at block start
  `reset()` + `initProcessing(maxBlock)` then update the factor (one-block gap is acceptable; do
  NOT try to crossfade an OS change).
- Consider a **separate render-time OS factor**: in `processBlock`, pick the higher factor when
  `isNonRealtime()` is true (offline bounce) — see architecture.md.

## ADAA (antiderivative anti-aliasing)

- ADAA is **in addition to** oversampling, not instead of it.
- Apply it where the **hardest** nonlinearity is. In the reference build the dominant aliaser was
  the **op-amp rail clip** (a hard clamp), not the soft diodes (whose fast-decaying harmonics
  oversampling already crushes). So 1st-order ADAA wrapped `railClip` (exact piecewise
  antiderivative), and diodes relied on oversampling + AccurateOmega. The chowdsp diode models also
  expose no closed-form antiderivative, so diode ADAA needs a bespoke omega-antiderivative — only
  worth it if listening reveals residual diode aliasing at low OS factors.
- 1st-order ADAA: `y = (F1(x) - F1(xPrev)) / (x - xPrev)`, with a midpoint fallback when
  `|x - xPrev|` is tiny. Update the state every sample so toggling is glitch-free.

## Pot tapers

- Honour the schematic's taper (audio/log vs linear). Build kits often substitute linear for cost —
  do NOT follow the kit, follow the schematic.
- See `utils/TaperUtils.h` and calibration doc §3 for the **audio-taper floor trap** on large pots.
- **The `10^(2x-2)` audio approximation is too aggressive** (only ~10% R at midpoint vs ~35-40% for
  a real audio pot) — it makes tone controls far too shallow. Prefer fitting a **power-law taper**
  (`R = Rmax * x^p`, p≈1.4) to captures, with Rmax ≈ the schematic pot value. See calibration
  doc §3b. Tone pots inside a feedback gain-set leg are coupled to gain — re-check levels after
  retapering them.

## Signal calibration

- Anchor `kInputRef` (volts per full-scale) from a real measurement — calibration doc §1.
- Internal nominal reference: pick one (e.g. −12 dBu) and stay consistent.
- Provide input + output trims, visually distinct from the pedal controls.

## Coupled controls

- Controls sharing a network (e.g. bass + drive in one feedback web) must be modelled as a **single
  coupled WDF network**, not independent processors. Use
  `wdft::ScopedDeferImpedancePropagation` when updating several parameters at once.
