# UI Rules (generic pedal plugin)

> The full visual spec for the reusable peripheral elements (side panels, halo trim knobs, VU
> meters, oversampling strip, resizable UI, bypass footswitch, LED) lives in
> `docs/ui-peripheral-spec.md`, and the working code is in `src/ui/`. This file is the high-level
> contract; the spec is the detail.

## Principles

- One custom `LookAndFeel` subclass (`PedalLookAndFeel`) — no default JUCE styling anywhere.
- All drawing in LookAndFeel overrides; zero drawing in component or DSP logic.
- UI fully decoupled from DSP — the visual design must be replaceable without touching DSP.
- No `foleys_gui_magic` / XML-driven builders.
- All colours are named `static constexpr juce::uint32` on `PedalLookAndFeel` — never hardcode hex
  in component code. (The included palette is a dark-navy theme; recolour per pedal.)

## Reusable peripheral elements (provided, drop-in)

These are circuit-agnostic and ship in `src/ui/` — reuse as-is across pedals:
- **`PedalLookAndFeel`** — colour palette, pedal-face background (mottled), rotary knobs (pedal +
  halo trim styles via `componentID == "trim"`), **octagonal-nut + silver-dome bypass footswitch**
  (`componentID == "bypass"`), ComboBox styling, segmented-button styling.
- **`VUMeter`** — 22-segment bar, red/yellow/green zones, proportional gap. `setLevel(0..1)` from a
  `Timer`. ~300 ms release; idle-noise gate in the timer (calibration doc §7).
- **`ThreePositionSwitch`** — generic vertical toggle; `setLabels()`, `onChange(pos)`.
- **`LEDIndicator`** — `setOn(bool)`; green active / dark bypassed, with glow.

## Layout contract

Three-column layout: left side panel (Input: label + halo trim + VU), centre pedal face
(pedal-specific control arrangement), right side panel (Output: label + halo trim + VU), with a
full-width oversampling/scale strip below. Side-panel internals scale with whatever column width
you allocate, so the centre face is free to differ per pedal. See the spec for exact proportions.

## Resizable UI

- `setResizable(true,true)` + `getConstrainer()->setFixedAspectRatio()` + `setSizeLimits()`
  (e.g. 0.5×–2.5× of a base size).
- Derive a scale factor in `resized()` from `getWidth() / kBaseW`; multiply every layout constant
  by it; call `refreshFonts(sc)` at the top of `resized()` (fonts must be re-set on resize, not in
  the constructor).
- Persist scale: per-session in `apvts.state` (`uiScale` property), cross-session default in
  `juce::ApplicationProperties`. Offer a scale popup with presets + "set current as default".

## Metering & threading

- `juce::Timer` (~30 ms) reads `getInputLevel`/`getOutputLevel` and the **`bypass` parameter**
  (read APVTS directly so the LED updates immediately, even before audio runs — do NOT rely on the
  `bypassed` atomic, which is only written in `processBlock`).
- Parameter binding via `SliderParameterAttachment` / `ComboBoxParameterAttachment` /
  `ButtonParameterAttachment`. No direct DSP calls from UI.
- Apply the VU idle-noise gate (calibration doc §7) and re-check its threshold whenever the output
  makeup changes.

## Trims

Input and output trim knobs use the **halo** style (`componentID == "trim"`) to stay visually
distinct from the pedal's own controls. Input trim sits pre-DSP (post → meter → chain); output trim
post-DSP (chain → meter → out).

## When a fixed name/position can't change but the underlying fact can

If a control's name or on-screen position is locked for compatibility/familiarity (e.g. it must
keep matching the hardware's physical layout) but you later learn an underlying fact about it has
changed (e.g. which one actually processes first — see `architecture.md`), don't silently rename or
reposition anything. Instead add a small, non-interactive label/badge near the control that states
the real fact directly (e.g. a processing-order marker), so the UI stays legible without requiring
the user to already know the internal correction. Keep it visually secondary (small, muted colour)
to the control's primary identity.
