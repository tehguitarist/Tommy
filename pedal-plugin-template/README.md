# Pedal Plugin Template

A starting point for building a new circuit-level guitar-pedal plugin (AU/VST3, JUCE 8+,
`chowdsp_wdf`), capturing hard-won generic engineering, validation tooling, and UI so you don't
reinvent the wheel each time. Nothing here is tied to a specific pedal — fill in the `<...>`
placeholders for yours.

```

The `src/ui/*` and `utils/*` files are **drop-in** — proven, production-tested code with all
pedal-specific names removed (`PedalLookAndFeel`, `ThreePositionSwitch`). The colour palette is a
dark-navy theme; recolour via the constants in `PedalLookAndFeel.h`.

## How to use it

1. Copy this folder to a new repo (or `cp -R` it and `git init`).
2. Add JUCE / chowdsp_wdf (+ optional xsimd) as submodules under `libs/` (see `.claude/rules/build.md`).
3. Drop the schematic images into `schematics/` and fill in `.claude/rules/circuit.md`.
4. Write `CMakeLists.txt` from `CMakeLists.txt.template` (replace every `<PLACEHOLDER>`; see build.md
   for the structure), then `PluginProcessor`/`PluginEditor` following `architecture.md`.
5. Follow the build/validation sequence in `CLAUDE.md`, validating each stage.
6. **Calibrate** per `docs/calibration-and-gain-staging.md` — measure `kInputRef` for your own rig;
   set the output makeup by **level-matching to your captures** (not to a headroom target).
7. **Validate** against real-pedal captures per `docs/validation-and-capture.md` (frequency
   response, THD-by-band, null depth) using the `analysis/` harness.

## The things that bit us before (so they don't bite you)

1. **Input level calibration** — the circuit is nonlinear, so the absolute input voltage decides
   where it clips. Anchor `kInputRef` (volts per full-scale) to a real measurement.
2. **The audio-taper floor** — a 1%-floored taper on a large (1 M) gain pot injects ~10 kΩ that
   adds ~8 dB of phantom minimum gain. Use `audioTaperR0` for pots whose minimum is ~0 Ω.
3. **The `10^(2x-2)` audio taper is too steep** — it puts ~10 % of pot R at the midpoint where a
   real audio pot is ~35–40 %, making tone controls too shallow. Fit a power-law taper from
   captures instead (calibration doc §3b).
4. **Output makeup is calibrated, not padded** — level-match it to the captures; it may exceed 1.0,
   and a faithful pedal genuinely exceeds 0 dBFS at high drive+volume (the output trim manages it).
   Do NOT pad it down "for headroom" — that breaks the A/B match (calibration doc §2).
5. **The capture MATRIX, not the test signal, is the usual limit** — sweep one knob at a time,
   capture a bypass/unity anchor, keep the recording gain fixed, and never truncate
   (validation doc §3).
